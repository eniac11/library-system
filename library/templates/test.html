                Elantris was the capital of Arelon: gigantic, beautiful, literally radiant, filled with benevolent
                beings who used their powerful magical abilities for the benefit of all. Yet each of these demigods was
                once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago,
                without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and
                Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of
                Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping --
                based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is
                considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the
                imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new
                status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert
                Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god. But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about
                Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father
                to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will
                bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.A rare epic fantasy that doesn't
                recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and
                fun, full of surprises and characters to care about. It's also the wonderful debut of a welcome new star
                in the constellation of fantasy. </div>
